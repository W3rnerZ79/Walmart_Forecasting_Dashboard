# Retail Forecasting (Walmart Public Dataset)
A hands-on project combining predictive modeling with business intelligence. I used Python to build a Weighted Moving Average forecasting script that prioritizes recent data trends, then integrated the data into Power BI to create an interactive dashboard for visualizing future demand and model accuracy.

The V2 dashboard tracks the performance of the **Memory-Active Forecast** model, highlighting how the integration of historical seasonal multipliers reduces error during high-volatility holiday periods.

#### 1. Full Timeline View (All Data)
* **What it shows:** Displays the entire time-series from 2010 through late 2012. It catches the transition where the model gains "memory" after the first 52 weeks.
* **Key Visual Trend:** In Jan 2011 (the first major peak), the baseline forecast significantly lags and flattens out behind actual sales. By Jan 2012, the dark blue **Memory-Active Forecast** accurately tracks and captures the massive seasonal spike.
* **Network-Wide Metrics:** Across the entire lifecycle, the network maintains a **5.78% MAPE** and a **$389.66M** gross variance.

#### 2. Memory-Active Phase View (2011+ Focused)
* **What it shows:** Filters the dashboard exclusively to the period where the 52-week seasonal multipliers are actively running.
* **Performance Leap:** Isolating the memory model demonstrates the drop in overall error. Individual store MAPEs drop significantly (e.g., Store 1 falls to **3.73%**, Store 4 drops to a highly accurate **3.38%**).
* **Optimized Metrics:** Network-wide **MAPE decreases to 4.27%**, MAE drops to **44.69K**, and the gross forecast variance is slashed nearly in half down to **182.99M**, showing off the improvement.
#### ⚠️ Performance Diagnostic & Next Steps

* **The Problem:** The V2 model captures fixed-date holidays perfectly but fails on **floating holidays** (like Easter and Thanksgiving). A strict 52-week shift creates a "Phase Shift Error," applying holiday multipliers to normal weeks when dates move across the retail calendar.
* **The Evidence:** The dashboard's volatility analysis shows that **60.53%** of the remaining model error is still concentrated entirely within holiday weeks.
* **The Fix:** Future iterations will replace the blind 52-week lag with an **Event-Aligned Holiday Dictionary** to explicitly map moving holidays to their exact historical counterparts.

## 🐍 Python Backend (V2)

The V2 script updates the pipeline to scale the moving average using historical multipliers, capturing major holiday spikes.

#### ⚙️ How it Works
* **52-Week Lag:** Pulls sales from the same week last year to establish a historical baseline.
* **Baseline Smoothing:** Takes a 4-week average of that lag to remove random anomalies.
* **Multiplier Calculation:** Divides last year's actual sales by the smoothed baseline to isolate the seasonal spike (e.g., a holiday yields a `2.0` multiplier).
* **Forecast Fusion:** Multiplies the 3-week WMA by the multiplier to blend current momentum with seasonal trends.
* **Clean & Export:** Calculates error metrics, drops null rows, and exports the clean data to `Walmart_Forecasted_V2.csv`.

## Walmart Forecasting Dashboard (V1)

A hands-on project combining predictive data modeling with business intelligence. This project uses Python to calculate a 3-week Weighted Moving Average (WMA) forecast on multi-store retail data, then integrates the outputs into Power BI to track performance and error metrics.

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Features
* **Backend:** Python (`pandas`, `numpy`) for data cleanup, WMA modeling, and error calculation.
* **Frontend:** Power BI dashboard featuring dynamic DAX KPIs, store-by-store performance tables, and trend lines comparing Actual Sales vs. Forecast.
* **Metrics Tracked:** Gross Revenue ($6.74B), Gross Forecast Variance ($518.41M), Mean Absolute Error (82.29K), and Network MAPE (7.69%).

#### ⚠️ Performance Diagnostic & Next Steps
* **The Problem:** The trend analysis revealed that the WMA model lags behind sharp seasonal spikes. Because it relies on a strict rolling window, it cannot anticipate sudden demand surges.
* **The Evidence:** The dashboard's volatility analysis proves that **77.1%** of the model's total forecasting error is concentrated entirely within holiday weeks.
* **The Fix:** Future iterations will upgrade the Python pipeline to include a holiday indicator multiplier

## 🐍 Python Backend (V1)

<img width="1024" height="887" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f61b003-7156-46c4-9e8d-9c03a5e43074" />

The Python script (`Walmart_Forecasting_V1.py`) handles the data preprocessing, core mathematical modeling, and error calculation before exporting the structured dataset to Power BI.

#### ⚙️ How it Works
1. **Data Sorting:** Ensures the timeline is sequential by sorting historical data chronologically by `Store` and `Date`.
2. **Custom WMA Calculation:** Utilizes a custom `weighted_moving_average` function. Using a rolling 3-week window, it applies optimized statistical weights `[0.15, 0.35, 0.50]` via a `lambda` dot product operation to prioritize recent trends.
3. **Store-Isolated Grouping:** Uses `.groupby('Store')` to ensure sales data from individual stores are forecasted independently without cross-contaminating historical data.
4. **Error Metrics Generation:** Programmatically calculates `Forecast_Error` and `Absolute_Error` for every individual data point to enable variance tracking on the dashboard.
5. **Automated Export:** Outputs the fully transformed time-series data into a streamlined CSV file (`Walmart_Forecasted.csv`) for seamless ingestion into Power BI.
