# Walmart_Forecasting_Dashboard
A hands-on project combining predictive modeling with business intelligence. I used Python to build a Weighted Moving Average forecasting script that prioritizes recent data trends, then integrated the data into Power BI to create an interactive dashboard for visualizing future demand and model accuracy.

# 📊 Automated Demand Forecasting & Supply Chain Dashboard

A hands-on project combining predictive data modeling with business intelligence. This project uses Python to calculate a 3-week Weighted Moving Average (WMA) forecast on multi-store retail data, then integrates the outputs into Power BI to track performance and error metrics.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Features
* **Backend:** Python (`pandas`, `numpy`) for data cleanup, WMA modeling, and error calculation.
* **Frontend:** Power BI dashboard featuring dynamic DAX KPIs, store-by-store performance tables, and trend lines comparing Actual Sales vs. Forecast.
* **Metrics Tracked:** Gross Revenue ($6.74B), Gross Forecast Variance ($518.41M), Mean Absolute Error (82.29K), and Network MAPE (7.69%).

## ⚠️ Performance Diagnostic & Next Steps
* **The Problem:** The trend analysis revealed that the WMA model lags behind sharp seasonal spikes. Because it relies on a strict rolling window, it cannot anticipate sudden demand surges.
* **The Evidence:** The dashboard's volatility analysis proves that **77.1%** of the model's total forecasting error is concentrated entirely within holiday weeks.
* **The Fix:** Future iterations will upgrade the Python pipeline to include a holiday indicator multiplier
